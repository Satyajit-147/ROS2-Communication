# üß† ROS 2 Communication Overview

This document summarizes the core communication concepts in **ROS 2**, with a focus on its decentralized architecture and the technologies that enable it.

## üöÄ Why ROS 2 Moved Away from ROS 1's Model

In ROS 1:
- A **central ROS Master** handled name resolution, node registration, and topic/service discovery.
- If the master failed or disconnected, **all node communication stopped**, making it unsuitable for large-scale, real-time, or distributed robotic systems.

In ROS 2:
- The system is **fully decentralized**.
- It uses the **Data Distribution Service (DDS)** middleware to support robust, scalable, and flexible communication.

This shift improves:
- **Reliability** (no single point of failure)
- **Scalability** (more devices, more nodes)
- **Real-time performance**
- **Support for embedded and distributed systems**

## üåê DDS (Data Distribution Service)

- DDS is a **middleware protocol** used in ROS 2 to handle message exchange between nodes.
- Based on the **publish-subscribe** model.
- Manages **automatic discovery**, **data serialization**, **transport protocols**, **QoS settings**, and more.

**Advantages of DDS:**
- Decentralized communication
- Built-in discovery
- Multiple transport layers (TCP, UDP)
- Quality of Service (QoS) control (latency, reliability, deadline, etc.)

## üì° Communication Protocols

### 1. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- DDS often uses **UDP** for faster, connectionless message passing.
- Suitable for real-time or lossy environments (e.g., robotics, drones).
- Supports **multicast**, helping in efficient data distribution to multiple subscribers.

### 2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Also supported via DDS when reliability is prioritized over speed.
- Ensures message delivery but adds latency.

DDS can **dynamically select** the best transport protocol depending on system needs and QoS settings.

## ü§ù Peer-to-Peer Discovery

- ROS 2 nodes **discover each other automatically** without needing a central master.
- Every node broadcasts its presence over the network using **Simple Discovery Protocol (SDP)** provided by DDS.
- This enables **true peer-to-peer communication**.

### Benefits:
- Resilience to failure
- Flexible in dynamic environments
- Suitable for distributed and multi-robot systems

## üó∫Ô∏è Discovery Server (Optional for ROS 2)

While peer-to-peer discovery works well, large networks can suffer from discovery overhead.

**Discovery Server**:
- An optional DDS feature used to improve performance in large or complex networks.
- Acts as a lightweight coordinator that stores and shares node information.
- Used in cases like:
  - Multi-robot systems across WANs
  - Reducing discovery traffic
  - Improving startup time in massive deployments
